# FinepointCGI Suggestions
## Introduction
Welcome to the Great Tutorial Suggestion Repository! 
This repository is designed to manage and track the tutorial suggestions that I receive. Your insights and requests are essential to the development of relevant and beneficial content. It's through your suggestions that we can ensure the material remains up-to-date, engaging, and practical.

## How does it work?
If there's a topic you'd like me to cover, you can simply open a ticket and provide a description of what you're interested in. This could be anything from explaining a complex programming concept, going through a specific coding tutorial, or providing an in-depth analysis of a particular technology.

By tracking all suggestions in one place, this system allows me to ensure that no suggestion is overlooked and that all requested topics are covered in a comprehensive and systematic way.

## Submitting a Suggestion
Open a Ticket: Hop on over to the "Issues" tab at the top of the repository, and hit the green "New issue" button.

Share Your Thoughts: In the issue description, tell me all about what you're hoping to see. The more detail, the better! I want to understand not just what you're looking for, but why it's important to you. Are there particular parts of the topic that you're finding tricky? Let me know!

Submit Your Suggestion: Once you're happy with your description, hit that "Submit new issue" button.

Once your ticket is open, it becomes a part of the queue of suggestions that I review regularly. While I can't promise every single suggestion will be acted upon right away, please know that each and every suggestion is valued and carefully considered.
